    "# Virtual environments\n",
    "When working with Python projects, *best practice is to have a separate virtual environment for each of them*. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary. When you install some Python package into your virtual environment, it'll be installed only into that specific environment. This means that you can have different versions of a single Python package in different virtual environments in the same machine. Key benefits:\n",

    "* Isolation\n",
    "* Different projects have different dependency versions\n",

    "\n",
    "A few words about structuring your projects. If you're developing, say, a relative big business application, it makes sense to separate some of the non-core business logic packages into a separate project and publish that as separate package. This way the \"main\" repository doesn't get bloated and it's more approachable for newcomers. Additionally, there's a change that you (or someone else) can easily reuse this \"separated\" package in the future, which is often the case e.g. for different kinds of utility functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a practical example. If your team has two different applications which interact with the same third party, it's beneficial to implement a separate client library for communication with it. This way a change is needed only in one place (in the client library) if the third party decides to make a backwards incompatible change in their API. \n",
