The *\\_\\_init\\_\\_* method lets you make sure that all relevant attributes are set to their proper values when an object is created from the class, before the object is used.\n",

    "The *self* keyword refers to the current object that you are working with. When you are writing a class, it lets you refer to certain attributes from any other part of the class.

    "To actually use a class, you create a variable such as *m3*. Then you set that equal to the name of the class, with the parameters required by the *\\_\\_init\\_\\_* method. Python creates an *object* from the *class*. An object is a single instance of the Car class; it has a copy of each of the class's variables, and it can do any action that is defined for the class. In this case, you can see that the variable m3 is a Car object from the *\\_\\_main\\_\\_* method. \n",

    "To access an object's variables or methods, you give the name of the object and then use *dot notation* to access the variables and methods. So to get the brand of *m3*, you use *m3.brand*.\n",
    "To modify the speed of the *m3* object, you can use *m3.speed_up()* or *m3.speed_down()*. Each object is its own instance of that class, with its own separate variables. All of the objects are capable of the same behavior, but each object's particular actions do not affect any of the other objects."

It allows you to use the class names directly in your program, so you have very clean and readable code. This can be a problem, however, if the names of the classes you are importing conflict with names that have already been used in the program you are working on. This is unlikely to happen in the short programs you have been seeing here, but if you were working on a larger program it is quite possible that the class you want to import from someone else's work would happen to have a name you have already used in your program.\n",

This approach is often used to shorten the name of the module, so you don't have to type a long module name before each class name that you want to use. But it is easy to shorten a name so much that you force people reading your code to scroll to the top of your file and see what the shortened name stands for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**from module_name import \\*** This is not recommended, for a couple reasons. First of all, you may have no idea what all the names of the classes and functions in a module are. If you accidentally give one of your variables the same name as a name from the module, you will have naming conflicts. Also, you may be importing way more code into your program than you need. If you really need all the functions and classes from a module, just import the module and use the `module_name.ClassName` syntax in your program."
