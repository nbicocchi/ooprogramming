<h2>Getting WebbIE</h2>
<p>WebbIE is free. You can get it from the link below. You have to run 
the setup.exe file that you get from the link, and everything will be 
installed for you. You will then have a desktop shortcut called "WebbIE"
 you can use to start the program. You can also find "WebbIE" in your 
Start menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webbie.org.uk/webbrowser/setup.exe">Installer for WebbIE Web Browser 4</a>
 Run this setup.exe file to install WebbIE Web Browser. Note that if you
 have installed the Beta already (before 6 January 2013) you will have 
to uninstall this first from Add/Remove Programs - sorry.</li>

are all supported. Windows Rt is not supported.</li>
<li>The Microsoft .Net Framework 4 Client Version is required, but the installer should take care of all of that for you.</li>

 get a response: this isn't my day job!</li>

<dd>Added online activation</dd>
<dd>Updated updater DLL</dd>
<dt>4.3.3  7 May 2013</dt>
<dd>Put in comprehensive error handling. This means that users should 
never see any error messages unless there is a comprehensive Windows 
system crash. Instead, things will just not work or work oddly. This is 
to increase confidence for users: ideally they get an error message 
which would help them to fix it, or report it to me to get fixed. 
However, this generally doesn't work as a process. </dd>
<dd>Made "show IE homepage" the default again because of negative feedback.</dd>
<dd>Made "localhost" work as URL.</dd>
<dd>Added support for aria-label and aria-labelledby (found on Facebook)</dd>
<dt>4.3.4  7 June 2013 Made about:blank load faster.</dt>

labels.</dd>
<dt>4.2.0 17 Feb 2013</dt>
<dd>Added Favorites window on B (or Ctrl+B) that shows all your 
favourites in a treeview window. There are now three ways to get at your
 favourites: the menu, the home page, and the popup window. I like the 
last best, but there's no reason to drop the others as yet. I should get
 rid of the home page, but someone wrote to say they love it, so I don't
 want to!</dd>
<dd>Made Print print the web page, not the text area. This lets you 
print copies of pages like bank details or ticket bookings correctly, 
with all the images and layout that people are going to expect to see. </dd>
<dd>Now a choice for home page: the IE home page, or the WebbIE home page (default)</dd>
<dt>4.1.0 6 Feb 2013</dt>
<dd>Removed Save Image function, since no-one used it.</dd>

<dd>Put Ctrl+I to show the web page back in to help people who must view the web page for some sites.</dd>
<dd>Removed Launch Internet Explorer since Ctrl+I makes it redundant.</dd>
<dd>Fixed WebbIE 4 shortcut going in "Alasdair King" folder in Start menu on Windows XP to 7</dd>
<dt>4.0.11 24 Jan 2013</dt>
<dd>First shipping release.</dd>

<h2>Technical notes</h2>

<p>The WebbIE Web Browser renders web pages as plain text then adds in 
some features to let users search Google, find the content of interest 
on the page and get RSS quickly. </p>

<p>The idea is that the task profile for screenreader users is similar 
to that of sighted users. That is, it's fast and efficient for users to 
get to the text they want in a page. This means that absolute fidelity 
to every chunk of content on the page takes second place to usefulness. 
For example, images that aren't A element children don't render, whether
 or not the IMG element has an alt tag, because they usually don't add 
any value in terms of information content. Every line that a 
screenreader user must encounter slows them down. The lines that are 
there must all count.</p>

<p>Internally WebbIE uses the Microsoft WebBrowser control. This gets 
the web content and provides the HTML DOM to WebbIE: WebbIE parses the 
DOM into text. (Actually, it uses both the W3C HTML DOM and the DHTML 
DOM, depending on what needs doing.) </p>

<p>WebbIE versions up to 3.X were all written in Visual Basic 6, which 
is a wonderfully productive language but dates from 1998 so gradually 
became harder to support. WebbIE 4 is built with VB.Net.</p>
